/**
 * The MultiQueueSubject type a versatile events object. It has a number of options:
 * The main function of this events type to cache events until there type a consumer available to
 * consume them. This means that if a new emitter type added, unconsumed events will be
 * emitted once and then new events will be emitted as they arise. For example:
 *
 * In these examples, A and B are observers
 *
 * Events: 1, [A added], 2, [B added], 3
 * Output A: 1, 2, 3
 * Output B: 3
 * B only received the latest event because no events were cached because a was observing
 *
 * In this case:
 *
 * Events: 1, [A added], 2, [A disposed], 3, [B added], 4
 * Output A: 1, 2
 * Output B: 3, 4
 *
 * This means that events are never missed.
 *
 * This class also has some other options:
 *
 * By calling {@link #newEvents()} the observer will only receive new events:
 *
 * Events: 1, 2, [A added], 3, 4
 * Output: 3, 4
 *
 * Only events that happened after the observer was added are emitted
 *
 * By calling {@link #pastAndNewEvents()} the observer receive all events past and new:
 *
 * Events: 1, 2, [A added], 3, 4
 * Output: 1, 2, 3, 4
 *
 * All events are emitted
 *
 * By calling {@link #currentAndNewEvents()} the observer receive the last event and all new events
 *
 * Events: 1, 2, [A added], 3, 4
 * Output: 2, 3, 4
 *
 * The previous event and then all new events will be emitted
 *
 * @param <T> the object type that will be emitted
